# CPlus-Plus-Renderer
I'm trying to make a 3D renderer with Win32Api and Win32Api alone, why chatGPT as my untrusty guide (seriously, it gets alot of stuff wrong).

It doesn't have any release builds or anything fancy like that yet, there is nothing to show for it.
Look around, I guess. It could work if you clone it onto VS.
